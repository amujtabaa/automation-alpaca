# Spine v2 Migration — Progress Ledger (resumable state of work)

**This file is the single source of truth for "where are we in the migration."**
It exists so that work can be *resumed* after a usage-budget refresh or a new
session without re-deriving context. Update it at every checkpoint commit.

Branch: `claude/confident-babbage-ti5cm8`.
Roadmap: `docs/REARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md` (phases 0→6).
Operating contract: root `CLAUDE.md`. Phase gate discipline: one phase, stop
for review at each boundary. External independent review is an outstanding gap
for every phase so far (proceeding was explicitly user-authorized).

---

## How to resume

1. Read root `CLAUDE.md` + the canonical read-order docs it `@`-imports.
2. Read this ledger's **Current position** below.
3. Run the suite to confirm a green baseline:
   ```
   TMPDIR="$PWD/.pytest-tmp" PYTHONPATH="$PWD" python -m pytest \
     --basetemp=.pytest-tmp -p no:cacheprovider -q -o addopts=""
   ```
   and the harness smoke checks:
   ```
   python harness/check_claude_imports.py
   python harness/check_stale_prompt_links.py
   ```
4. Pick up at the first unchecked box under **Current position**.

## Phase status summary

| Phase | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Docs, inventory, migration seams | ✅ done (`7a25649`) — report: `docs/SPINE_PHASE0_INVENTORY.md`, `docs/SPINE_PHASE0_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` |
| 1 | Facade shell + characterization | ✅ done (`d146e0e`, `afe8543`) — report: `docs/SPINE_PHASE1_FACADE_REPORT.md` |
| 2 | Event schema + replay scaffolding | ✅ done (`7ba8dd0`…`60d38a0`) — report: `docs/SPINE_PHASE2_EVENT_LOG_REPORT.md` |
| 3 | Safety-critical event-first migration | 🚧 in progress — waves 3a-shadow / 3a-truth / 3b done; waves 3c/3d/3e remain |
| 4 | Reconciliation engine | ⬜ not started |
| 5 | Import-boundary enforcement | ⬜ not started |
| 6 | Legacy table demotion/removal | ⬜ not started |

---

## Phase 2 — Event schema + replay scaffolding — ✅ CLOSED

All substeps done; adversarial review (workflow `w32i9qgc8`, 4 lenses +
synthesis) returned **safe to finalize**; 5 low/nit findings applied (see
`docs/SPINE_PHASE2_EVENT_LOG_REPORT.md` §6). Commits: `7ba8dd0` (log + projector
+ replay), `b0434f3` (coverage→100%), `b46b83b` (matrix/report/ledger),
`60d38a0` (review remediation). Full suite green, `app/events/` 100%.

Locked design decisions (kept, for the record): `ExecutionEvent` is distinct
from the audit `Event`; Phase 2 is additive/shadow (no `event_truth` flip, no
production writer); the projector reuses `apply_fill` (formula single-sourced);
primary/spawn/TradingState projectors deferred to Phase 3 (recorded per the
CLAUDE.md conflict rule, not silently picked).

## Current position: Phase 3 — Safety-critical event-first migration

**The largest phase and the first that CHANGES behavior.** It resolves the
ADR-001/002/003 conflicts characterized in Phase 0 by making the event log
authoritative for migrated flows. Break into sub-waves; each wave:
characterize → implement → adversarial-verify → report → commit.

**Planned sub-wave order (lowest-risk first):**

- [x] **Wave 3a-shadow — broker-authoritative fill ingestion + dedup →
      `shadow_evented`** (Decision 1 / INV-5). `append_fill` now also appends a
      broker-authoritative `FILL` `ExecutionEvent` atomically with the fill row
      (both stores, via extracted unlocked/cursor helpers); the replay
      projection is proven == the fill-table position, dual-store parity holds,
      dupe/reject paths emit nothing. Additive — full suite green, no behavior
      change to position derivation. `tests/test_spine_phase3_shadow_fills.py`.
      Fill ingestion is `shadow_evented` in the matrix. **Adversarial review
      (workflow `wub26fmm1`, 4 lenses + synthesis, fault-injection verified):
      safe to finalize — 0 correctness defects; 3 test-hardening findings
      applied (fault-injection atomicity guard [mutation-tested live],
      multi-symbol/fold-to-flat parity, SELL-event price assertion), 1 future
      backfill note recorded above.** Commits `bf60d74` + `e7c423c`.
- [x] **Wave 3a-truth — flip fill ingestion to `event_truth`.** Position is now
      derived from the event log (`project_symbol_position` folds the symbol's
      `FILL` events) in BOTH stores; the fill table is a compatibility
      read-model. Backfill at `initialize()` emits a `FILL` event per
      pre-wave-3a fill row (idempotent, 1:1 in append order). Behavior-preserving
      (whole position/fill/monitoring/routes/Hypothesis corpus green =
      characterization, matrix rule 4); truth proven to have moved
      (`tests/test_spine_phase3_fill_event_truth.py`: a FILL event with no fill
      row moves position; backfill covers orphan fills). Matrix rules 2/3
      satisfied (backfill + dual-store parity). Fill ingestion + dedup are
      `event_truth`. **Note:** fill + event are written in one atomic block
      (event authoritative, fill table a read-model); `prior_filled`/dedup
      accounting still read the fill-table read-model (accurate, lower-risk —
      not a position-truth concern). **Adversarial review (`wojsqwhiq`) caught a
      BLOCKER + MEDIUMs, all fixed + regression-tested (`5fdc993`):**
      the initial count/offset backfill was INVERTED (pre-shadow fills are a
      prefix, not a suffix) — replaced with an additive, identity-matched
      backfill that appends each fill's event through the deduped writer (never
      deletes an event-only reconciliation fill); null-source fills now carry a
      deterministic `fill:{order_id}:@{fill.id}` key so they are matchable.
      Blocker reproduced firsthand (qty 200→400) + mutation-tested. Also flipped
      `current_exposure`/`close_session` symbol enumeration to the event log
      (both stores agree) and added `idx_exec_events_symbol_type`. The
      behavior-preservation lens found the core flip sound (0 defects).
      - **Still open for wave 3b — ADR-001 oversell tolerance:** the projector's
        `apply_fill` reject-by-raise (comment at `app/events/projectors.py`)
        must become quarantine-tolerant once broker-authoritative overfills can
        be recorded, else a recorded oversell aborts the whole replay.
- [x] **Wave 3b — overfill / negative-position quarantine** (ADR-001).
      - [x] **Part 1 — projector oversell-tolerance + quarantine detection**
        (`563ed4d`). `apply_fill(..., allow_short=True)` records a crossing
        sell as a negative position instead of raising (the default still raises
        — the long-only backstop for *local* input is preserved); the
        projector uses it (a recorded broker FILL is a fact to project, not an
        error). `quarantined_symbols(events)` flags any symbol whose event-log
        position is negative. **Additive/inert on the live path** — nothing
        records an oversell yet (`append_fill` still rejects local negatives), so
        the whole position/fill corpus stays green.
        `tests/test_spine_phase3b_overfill_quarantine.py`.
      - [x] **Part 2 — record path + block** (`fa6e72a`). `append_fill`
        now RECORDS a *broker-authoritative* overfill (a SELL crossing long-only
        through flat) — `plan_append_fill` step 5+6 appends the fill row + a
        `fill_overfill_quarantined` audit event + the broker-authoritative `FILL`
        `ExecutionEvent`, all atomically — instead of reject-and-drop. Intrinsic
        malformed-input rejects (`fill_value_reason`: non-positive qty/price,
        cumulative-over-order, symbol/side mismatch) are UNCHANGED and still
        reject. Both stores gained `list_quarantined_symbols()` (derived from the
        event log via `quarantined_symbols`); `create_order_for_candidate` passes
        `quarantined=` to the planner, which blocks autonomous BUY intent for a
        quarantined symbol (`order_intent_blocked_quarantine` audit event,
        `OrderIntentBlockedError`). Position now derives the recorded short
        (`get_position` returns negative). Characterization + parity tests
        migrated (reject→record): `test_spine_v2_characterization`,
        `test_sqlite_store`, `test_input_validation`, `test_position_folding`,
        `test_store_core`; the "reject→no shadow event" property re-pinned via a
        still-rejected `InvalidFillError` path in `test_spine_phase3_shadow_fills`.
        Replay reproduces the quarantine per-store and across memory+SQLite
        (ADR-001 required test). Full suite green (1441 passed), coverage 95.65%.
        Fill overfill / negative-position handling is `event_truth`. Commits
        `fa6e72a` + ledger `1d768b7`.
      - [x] **Part 2 fix — adversarial-review remediation** (`44f4592`).
        Review workflow `w0mjp9fx2` (4 lenses + synthesis, mutation-verified)
        returned **FIX_REQUIRED** with two coupled defects, both fixed +
        regression-tested:
        - **HIGH — quarantine was memoryless.** `quarantined_symbols` keyed off
          the *current* projected sign (`quantity < 0`), so a covering BUY fill
          (a pre-existing order, a reconciliation cover) that lifted the short
          back to ≥0 silently un-quarantined the symbol and resumed autonomous
          trading with no review — an ADR-001 violation ("must not continue
          autonomous trading from such a state"). Fixed: **latch to the fold
          history** — a symbol is quarantined once its FILL fold ever crosses
          negative, durable/replay-stable, cleared only by a future audited
          reconciliation (Phase 4). Also **gated the submission-claim path**
          (`plan_claim_order_for_submission` + both stores) so a *pre-existing*
          CREATED autonomous BUY for a quarantined symbol is HELD
          (`symbol_quarantined`), not just newly-created intent; protective/
          flatten SELLs stay exempt (exits allowed).
        - **MEDIUM — `apply_fill` cost-basis corruption on short recovery.** The
          BUY branch accumulated `cost_basis` additively over a zeroed short base,
          so a symbol that crossed through flat and returned long derived a wrong
          `average_price`/`cost_basis` (inflated CAPI exposure). Fixed: covering a
          short re-establishes basis from the covering fill alone; behavior-
          preserving for every normal (non-short) fold.
        - **LOW — overfill idempotency untested.** Added a replayed-overfill
          idempotency test (INV-5 on the record path) + short-recovery cost-basis
          + durable-latch + claim-hold tests. Full suite green (1455 passed),
          coverage 95.70%. **Re-review (`w587o6zou`, 3 lenses + synthesis,
          3 mutations each caught): `FIX_COMPLETE` — D1 + D2 both fully closed,
          0 confirmed findings, no new BLOCKER/HIGH.** Commit `44f4592` + ledger
          `7731f6d`. ✅ Wave 3b is independently reviewed clean.
- [~] **Wave 3c — timeout/504 `TIMEOUT_QUARANTINE`** (ADR-002). Replace blind
      redrive (characterized in `tests/test_spine_v2_characterization.py`
      Flow 2) with quarantine + targeted reconcile-by-`client_order_id`. **Design
      + recorded conflicts (C1–C6): `docs/SPINE_WAVE3C_PLAN.md`** (mapped by a Plan
      agent over the submit/recovery/adapter path; Phase-3/Phase-4 boundary set —
      wave 3c does a single-order read-only targeted query, defers the mass
      reconcile engine to Phase 4).
      - [ ] **Part 1 — inert scaffolding.** `OrderStatus.TIMEOUT_QUARANTINE` +
        transitions + audit `EventType`s; `AmbiguousBrokerError`; read-only
        `get_order_by_client_order_id` (interface + 3 adapters + `seed_venue_order`
        on mock/sim); store `transition_order_evented` (planner + both stores);
        `timeout_quarantined_order_ids` projector + `list_timeout_quarantined_orders`.
        Additive/inert — nothing routes to it; full corpus stays green.
      - [ ] **Part 2 — wiring.** Monitoring routes `AmbiguousBrokerError` →
        quarantine (guard BEFORE the generic release); `_resolve_timeout_quarantine`
        step + config bound; adapter classification split; Flow-2 characterization
        migration; cockpit bucket; docs (matrix → `event_truth`). Adversarial review.
- [ ] **Wave 3d — kill/TradingState FSM** (§8): `Active`/`Reducing`/`Halted`
      replacing the binary flags (Flow 5).
- [ ] **Wave 3e — manual flatten + emergency reduce** (ADR-003, Flow 1). Depends
      on the TradingState FSM (3d).

**Resume hint:** Waves 3a + 3b are done and green. Start **Wave 3c
(timeout/504 `TIMEOUT_QUARANTINE`, ADR-002)**. Re-read `docs/adr/ADR-002`,
`tests/test_spine_v2_characterization.py` Flow 2 (the pinned blind-redrive
current behavior), and the submission/claim path
(`app/store/core.py:plan_claim_order_for_submission`, the broker-submit recovery
ledger D-017, `app/monitoring.py` submit flow). Phase 3 flips a flow to
`event_truth` only when the 6 conditions in `docs/MIGRATION_MATRIX.md`
"Migration rule" hold.
