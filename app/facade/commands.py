"""Typed command facade — Spine v2 (ADR-005 / Spine v2 §10).

``ExecutionCommandFacade`` is a ``Protocol`` defining the command surface
FastAPI routes depend on. As of Phase 6 (ARCH-002 doc refresh):

* **Every command method is real** — implemented by
  ``app.facade.store_backed.StoreBackedCommandFacade`` and wired into its
  route (order approval/reject, manual flatten, emergency-reduce, cancel,
  kill switch, pause/resume buys, close session, dev inject). None of the
  command methods raise ``NotYetImplementedError`` anymore.
* **The route→facade boundary is enforced** by import-linter Contract 5
  (`.importlinter`; ADR-005 / ADR-006) — routes reach the store/engine/broker
  only through this facade, no longer directly.
* **Provisional vocabulary only:** the ``primary``/``spawn``/``TradingState``
  Spine v2 target names have no current-codebase analogue, so the *query*-side
  ``list_primaries``/``list_spawns``/``kill_state`` are the only facade methods
  that still raise ``NotYetImplementedError`` (see ``app.facade.queries``).

Method names/signatures are provisional and use the Spine v2 target
vocabulary (``primary``/``spawn``/``TradingState``), which does not exist in
the current codebase (``docs/MIGRATION_MATRIX.md``) — don't treat this as a
stable contract for the still-unimplemented methods.

    Per ADR-005, a route may validate HTTP shape, authenticate, construct a

    response — it must not mutate a store, call a broker adapter, or call a
    monitoring helper directly. Every route currently does at least one of
    those; migrating them is Phase 1+, not this skeleton.

    Each command is expected to raise :class:`~app.facade.errors.
    EngineNotReadyError` when the engine isn't ready, and a structured
    :class:`~app.facade.errors.FacadeError` subclass otherwise — never a raw
